# Milk Protocol 🐮🥛 
Let's get milked.

### The Protocol
When cow comes, everyone wants to get milked. The Milk Protocol is designed to yield MILK for those who want to get milked. Stake tokens on Cow, got MILK for free.

### Milk Token
- Total Supply: 13292 MILK
- First Distribution Pool：WBNB

### Distribution
Rather than allocating a portion of the supply to the founding team, MILK is being distributed with no premine, no founder shares, no VC interests — simply equal-opportunity staking distribution to attract a broad and vision-aligned community to steward the future of the protocol and token.
